// Task 5. Make a program that asks numbers from the user, until user gives 0 and then program ends. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.

// Task 6. Make a program that asks 25 numbers form the user. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.

// Task 7. Make a program that ask first one number from the user. After that the program asks: ”Do you want to continue giving numbers?(y/n)”. 
// If user answers y, the program continues to ask another number. If user answers n, program ends. In the end program prints out average of the numbers.

// Task 8. Make a program that asks first how many numbers user wants to give to the program. After that program asks those numbers. In the end program prints out the smallest number that user gave.

// Task 9. Make a program that asks ten numbers and in the end prints out two biggest numbers.

// Task 10. Make a program that asks ten numbers. Program calculates and prints out sum and average, also prints out the smallest and biggest number.
